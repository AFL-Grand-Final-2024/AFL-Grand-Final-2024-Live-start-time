The Sydney Swans are now locked in to face the Brisbane Lions, with the two teams hoping to redeem themselves after both losing in their last grand final appearances.

Where can I watch the AFL grand final in-person?​
For fans in NSW and Queensland who can't make the trip down to the MCG, live sites will be set up in Sydney and Brisbane for the grand final.

Footy fans in Sydney can join a watch party at the SCG, either from the Ladies Stand or by staking out a spot on the field. Gates open from 1:30pm.

Brisbane footy fans can head to South Bank Parklands, where screens at South Bank Cultural Forecourt and South Bank Streets Beach will be showing the game from 1pm.

Who is playing in the AFL grand final?​
The Sydney Swans will take on the Brisbane Lions in what will be a chance at redemption for both teams, who were runners-up in the previous two grand finals.

The Swans were flattened during their last grand final appearance in 2022, going down to Geelong by 81 points.

Meanwhile, Brisbane will hope to bounce back after losing a heartbreaking grand final last year to Collingwood by just 4 points.

Sydney and Brisbane have faced each other just once this season, with the Lions eking out a two-point victory in a thriller at the Gabba in Round 19.

The two sides have never faced each other in a grand final in the modern AFL era, but their precursor clubs — South Melbourne and Fitzroy — did face off in the 1899 VFL final.

That match, played under torrential rain in front of just under 5,000 spectators, saw Fitzroy come out on top 27-26.

Who is the entertainment at the grand final?​
Pop star Katy Perry will be headlining the pre-game entertainment, in what will be her second show at the MCG.

Perry previously headlined the entertainment at the Women's T20 World Cup in March 2020.

The multi-platinum selling songstress will be performing just a week after the release of her latest album, 143.

Perry, who previously performed at the 2015 Super Bowl half-time show, told the ABC she couldn't wait to hear "100,000 people singing all the songs at the top of their lungs".

"I'm really excited to take it up a notch," she said.

Australian singer and swimmer Cody Simpson will perform the Australian national anthem, while Christine Anu and her daughter Zipporah Corser-Anu will performer for the First Nations ceremony.

And, as is tradition, Mike Brady will be on hand to perform 'Up There Cazaly' during the AFL retiree motorcade.

Who will present the awards?​
Either three-time Lions premiership coach Leigh Matthews or former Sydney captain Stuart Maxwell will present the Premiership Cup, depending on which team is victorious.

Three-time Geelong premiership winner Steve Johnson will present the Norm Smith Medal for the player judged to be best-on-ground on grand final day.

David Parkin, who coached four premiership sides across three decades, will present the Jock McHale medal to the premiership winning coach.

In addition, this year will see the first ever Ron Barassi medal presented to the captain of the winning side, memorialising the 10-time premiership winning coach and player.

Former Geelong captain and 1963 premiership winner Fred Wooller will present the new medal.
